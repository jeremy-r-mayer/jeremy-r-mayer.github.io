This is a multi-purpose virtual space, intended for, but not limited to:

- documenting things I expect to forget
- excessive nostalgia
- photos of my dog, may he rest in peace

If you're interested in how this site is made, visit [der springenwerk](/meta/der-springenwerk.html).

I can be contacted [thusly](mailto:jeremy@0x4A.org?subject=Hi!).
