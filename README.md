## DARE ALRIGHT THINGS
On February 22, 2021, the good geniuses at the [NASA Jet Propulsion Labratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) have [successfully landed](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/videos/?v=461) the shockingly adorable all-terrain minivan [Perseverance](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/) on the surface of Mars. This feat was acheived by hurling the rover towards the red planet in the carny womb of a [gravitron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitron), then lowering it to the surface by way of an overhead crane wearing a jet-pack. Later, when a suitable location is found, Perserverance will offload [Ingenuity](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/), a small helicopter currently hitching a ride on the rover's belly. If this doesn't make you giddy then you are *dead* inside.

Also, I've started another new web project - a journal of sorts about seeking the middle, trying to be okay, and finding some comfort in just being alright. Exciting stuff.
