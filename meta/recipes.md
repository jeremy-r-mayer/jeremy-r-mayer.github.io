# Bread

Bread is a basic survival skill.

## Equipment
- Stand Mixer
- Baking Sheet
- Parchment Paper
- Oven-Safe Pan
- Cooling Rack

## Ingredients
- 2 1/4 cups `Warm Water`
- 2 tablespoons `Sugar`
- 1 tablespoon `Active Dry Yeast`
- 1 tablespoon `Salt`
- 2 tablespoons `Olive Oil`
- 30.7 ounces or 870 grams `All-Purpose Flour`
- Several `Ice Cubes`

## Directions
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer combine the `warm water`, `sugar` and `active dry yeast`. Allow to sit for 5 minutes or until the yeast begins to foam.
2. Add the `salt`, `olive oil`, and `all-purpose flour` to the mixer bowl. Using a dough hook attachment, mix slowly until combined, then increase to medium speed and knead until dough is smooth and pulls away from the bowl. Remove the dough, clean and oil the bowl, then return the dough to the bowl and cover with a towel for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.
3. Remove dough from bowl and divide in half. Pat each piece of dough into a thick rectangle. Roll the dough starting from the long edge and pinch the ends to seal. Arrange the loaves side-by-side and seam-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Slash the tops of each loaf and cover with a clean towel. Allow to rise for 1 additional hour.
4. Place an oven rack in the middle position and another in the lowest position. Preheat to 375 degrees F.
5. When the oven is ready, place the over-safe pan filled with `ice cubes` on the lower rack and parchment-lined baking sheet with bread loaves on the middle rack. Close the oven door quickly.
6. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes with convection setting enabled, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, then place on a cooling rack.

# Soft Pretzels

In a best-case scenario soft pretzels are my post-apocalypse currency of choice.

## Equipment
- Stand Mixer
- 2 Baking Sheets
- Saucepan or Pot (about 8 quarts)
- Parchment Paper
- Cooling Rack

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups `Warm Water`
- 1 tablespoons `Sugar`
- 2 teaspoons `Kosher Salt`
- 2 1/4 teaspoons `Active Dry Yeast` (1 package)
- 22 ounces `All-Purpose Flour` (or about 4 1/2 cups)
- 2 ounces `Unsalted Butter`, melted
- 10 cups `Water`
- 3/4 cups `Baking Soda`
- 1 large `Egg Yolk`, beaten with 1 tablespoon of `Water`
- `Pretzel Salt`, or `Course Sea Salt`

## Directions
1. Combine `warm water`, `sugar` and `kosher salt` in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle `active dry yeast` on top. Allow to sit for 5 minutes or until the yeast begins to foam, then add the ` all-pupose flour` and melted `unsalted butter`. Using a dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until combined, then set to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the bowl. Remove the dough, clean and oil the bowl, then return the dough to the bowl and cover with a towel for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.
2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
3. Combine the `baking soda` and 10 cups of `water` in a large saucepan or pot and bring to a rolling boil.
4. While the oven preheats and water boils, turn out dough and divide into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into whatever shape you like and place onto parchment-lined baking sheet.
5. Place pretzels into the boiling water one at a time for 30 seconds. Remove them and place them back onto the parchment-lined baking sheet. When all pretzels have been boiled, brush the top of each pretzel with the `egg yolk` and `water` mixture and sprinkle with `pretzel salt` or `coarse sea salt`.
6. Bake until dark golden brown, usually 15-20 minutes, then move to a cooling rack.
