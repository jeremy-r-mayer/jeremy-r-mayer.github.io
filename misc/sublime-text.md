Using Sublime Text 4 beta and Sublime Merge I find my list of necessary packages has grown very short.

- [packagecontrol.io](https://packagecontrol.io) - Package manager.
- [RemoteSubl](https://github.com/randy3k/RemoteSubl) - Allows remote editing via SSH tunnel with [rmate](https://github.com/aurora/rmate).
